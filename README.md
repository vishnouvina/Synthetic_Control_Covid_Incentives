# Covid-19 Vaccination Incentives in the US
Projet realized with the Laboratoire de Mathématiques et Informatique de CentraleSupélec (MICS).

With COVID-19 having emerged as the most widespread human pandemic disease in a century, the need to control its spread to avoid massive loss of life became more than necessary, and extremely fast. Several vaccines were developed and the task of policy makers was suddenly to convince the reluctant population to be vac- cinated by various means. While some countries have chosen a policy of mandatory vaccination or punitive incentives, many states in the United States have adopted various incentives to try to increase vaccination coverage. A study we conducted in recent months quantified the effect of these measures on the proportion of the po- pulation vaccinated, using the synthetic control method, by simulating what would have happened without these measures. The aim now is to generalize this study to smaller scales, to improve the results of our previous study, to quantify their robust- ness and to provide a tool that can be used by policy makers to adapt their behavior in light of the results obtained.
